# MAE259B_2022_Spring
This class is dedicated for studying on tdiscrete differential
geometry and machine learning â€“ to the mechanics of rods, plates, shells, and
robots. 

I do really appreciate my friend and my teammate zhengqi zhong & ruoning ren help on helping me solve problem 2 and 3 

The HW1 folder contains Problem 1 through 3 code. The 1st derivative and 2nd derivative
of streching and bending energy function is also given in the folder

To Run Problem 1 for simulation:
Just click the Problem1_explicit.m & Problem1_implicit.m 

Problem 2 for simulation:
Just click Problem2.m

Problem 3 for simulation:
Just click Problem3.m
